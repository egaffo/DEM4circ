## Benchmarking differential expression methods on circular RNA bulk RNA-seq data

CircRNA expression data from RNA-seq have particular characteristics, such as a high proportion of small and zero counts, which might hamper commonly used differential expression methods.

This repository contains the code used to benchmark 38 differential expression pipelines on circRNA expression RNA-seq data. 
The theoretical considerations supporting the software are described in:
"Buratin A, Bortoluzzi S, Gaffo E. Systematic benchmarking of statistical methods to assess differential expression of circular RNAs. Brief Bioinform. 2023"
